*** Deploy
**** Using Apache and mod_wsgi

     - Install Apache WSGI module =mod_wsgi=
     - Configure Apache(TODO)
     - Configure Django WSGI(TODO)

     - Install dependencies
       (for MySQL)

       CentOS
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         sudo yum install python-devel
         sudo yum install mysql-devel
       #+END_SRC sh

       Ubuntu-12.04
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         sudo apt-get install python-dev
         sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
       #+END_SRC sh

     - Collect all static files.

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       python manage.py collectstatic
     #+END_SRC sh

     This will collect all the static files(including admin CSS/JS)
     and copy them to =aakashlabs/aakashlabs/static=.

     - Restart the server
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         sudo service httpd restart
       #+END_SRC sh

*** Populate database

     - =populate_al.py= will create an Admin user and populates the
       database.

     - And run the script
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh 
         python populate_al.py
       #+END_SRC sh
       It will prompt for admin password.

       Alternately you can run
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         python manage.py syncdb
       #+END_SRC sh
       and insert data using the 'admin' interface.

     - Finally run development server
       #+BEGIN_SRC sh
         python manage.py runserver
       #+END_SRC sh

** How to Contribute?

   - Please create a separate branch(with appropriate name) and send
     pull request. 

   - Your branch name should be specific to your changes/features. Say
     for example if you added a new view & a template to show
     /project/ details, name it as *new_project_template*. 

   - Your code and changes should be properly commented.

   - Don't change models. If you feel that it is a necessity, please
     raise an issue first. Let others know why you feel it is
     important(Others work may be based of present model and your
     change will /screw/ their work.)

   - I like small & specific changes. So don't send variety of changes
     in one go.
