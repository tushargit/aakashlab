## How to Contribute?

   - Please create a separate branch(with appropriate name) and send
     pull request. 

   - Your branch name should be specific to your changes/features. Say
     for example if you added a new view & a template to show
     /project/ details, name it as *new_project_template*. 

   - Your code and changes should be properly commented.

   - Don't change models. If you feel that it is a necessity, please
     raise an issue first. Let others know why you feel it is
     important(Others work may be based of present model and your
     change will /screw/ their work.)

   - I like small & specific changes. So don't send variety of changes
     in one go.
