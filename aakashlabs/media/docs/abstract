Group Broadcast is Android App in which leader can share PDF& PPT along with photos and documents and the group leader's device acts as the Wi-Fi access point connecting all the other devices together.
In this Application the group leader has to choose "create group" option which automatically turns on the Wi-Fi access point. All other devices joining a Group Broadcast session will recognize the access point the same way as any other Wi-Fi network. When you launch the program, you choose "Join Group" instead of "Create Group." The program then automatically searches for available Wi-Fi networks and connects when it finds one called "Group Broadcast”. Once you've joined a group, you see a list of possible information to share pictures, documents or paint and multiple files can be shared in one session. In these scenario’s where we don’t have black board or projector. So concepts like study outside classroom are possible. Group Broadcast makes sharing across mobile devices easier than ever before for example whether it’s sharing photos with your friends at a coffee shop or making a business presentation.
