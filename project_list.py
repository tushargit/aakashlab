The previous proposed systems are sometimes very large as a big system, therefore it is not easy to move to other locations, requires raw data from the case sites because another additional techniques are utilized to process this data and the technology is only available for laboratory experiments. Meanwhile, air pollution monitoring and control are totally required in order to maintain the air quality in the tolerable and expected limits. The purpose of this project is to build an air quality monitoring system which could measure the levels of gases and record them which could be accessed any time.",
