				Every Indian learner desires a chance to receive the highest quality education. Scarcity of trained teachers hinders this aspiration. Difficulty in accessing the best educational contents, in an affordable manner, further accentuates the problem. Effective use of Information and Communication Technologies helps in significantly addressing these twin issues. Aakash Tablet, launched by Government of India, is emerging as a key ICT tool for this purpose. When used in conjunction with the high speed network of <a href="">National Knowledge Network(NKN)</a>, Aakash has a great potential to become a ubiquitous and effective ICT tool for students and teachers. <br><br></p><div style="direction: ltr"> <p  align="justify"><div  style=" width:320px;height=700px; float:right;"><img src="{% static 'images/aakashdbp.jpg' %}"  style=" width:300px;height=400px;" />  </div>    &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;    &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; Aakash project at IIT Bombay is dedicated to the development of useful applications and contents for use with Aakash. It attempts to empower teachers by using a unique blend of technology, e-contents, and an innovative pedagogy. While the main focus of this project is on engineering education, it is proposed to use the creative talent of these professional students and teachers, to develop applications and contents for all levels of education, including school education in Indian languages.</br></br>

<!--In March 2012, the Aakash project was transferred to IIT Bombay, with CDAC as its testing partner. As IIT Rajasthan selected Datawind through due diligence, following all CAG norms, IIT Bombay decided to procure Aakash 2 from the same vendor. IIT Bombay negotiated with Datawind once again and froze the prices at Rs. 2,263. In July 2012, Datawind agreed to upgrade the device to a better one without any cost escalation. The new device would have 512 MB RAM, 1GHz ARM Cortex A8 processor, Android 4.0 operating system and a gravity sensor, all upgrades over the purchase order issued by IIT Bombay in May 2012.</br></br>-->

<br>Aakash 2 was formally launched by Hon'ble President of India, Shri. Pranab Mukherjee, on 10 November 2012. Honble HRM Dr. Pallam Raju, Honble Ministers of State Dr. Shashi Tharoor and Shri. Jitin Prasada, and Secretaries from MHRD.

The main objective of the Aakash project at IIT Bombay, is empowerment of teachers and students in engineering colleges. We have already deployment Aakash tablets in a large number of engineering colleges in the country, with two objectives.<br>
<br><b>The first </b>is to test and enhance the effectiveness of these tablets for use in a classroom environment. <br>
<b>The second </b>is the development of new educational applications and contents on Aakash, largely through final year R&D projects done by BE/ME students.<br>
In coming years, the Aakash tablet launched by MHRD, is likely to become an ubiquitous tool in the hands of students. Our research team at IIT bombay is developing useful Open Source applications and contents for different versions of the tablet. These range from animations to scientific computing, and encompass the entire educational spectrum covering schools, colleges, and professional studies.
