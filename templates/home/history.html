<h4> Aakash II </h4>
<div align="justify"> <p  align="justify"><div style=" float:right; padding-left:10px" >  <img src="{% static 'images/Aakash Tablet.jpg' %}"  style=" width:300px;height=400px;" />  </div>In March 2012, the Aakash project was transferred to IIT Bombay, with CDAC as its testing partner. As IIT Rajasthan selected Datawind through due diligence, following all CAG norms, IIT Bombay decided to procure Aakash 2 from the same vendor. IIT Bombay negotiated with Datawind once again and froze the prices at Rs. 2,263. </br>In July 2012, Datawind agreed to upgrade the device to a better one without any cost escalation. The new device would have 512 MB RAM, 1GHz ARM Cortex A8 processor, Android 4.0 operating system and a gravity sensor, all upgrades over the purchase order issued by IIT Bombay in May 2012.The specifications of this device are 800 MHz ARM Cortex A8, 256 MB RAM, 2GB NAND flash, 2GB SD card, 7”display with 800x480 resolution, four point  multi touch projective capacitive touch panel, Android 2.3 or later. They also agreed to provide the tablet at Rs. 2,276, the rupee equivalent of $49.98 on the day the purchase order was placed. This would more correctly account for the delays, while protecting against the fluctuations in the exchange rates. This new improved device was christened as Aakash 2.</br></br>

The low cost access and computing device was christened Aakash and was launched on 5 Oct. 2011 by the then Human Resource Development Minister, Shri Kapil Sibal.
In order to bring Aakash closer to people’s expectations, the specifications were redrawn in a meeting held between MHRD, IIT Rajasthan and Datawind in Nov. 2011. In this meeting, Datawind agreed to provide a capacitive touch screen in lieu of the resistive screen.<br>Aakash tablet is part of the central government Rs 4612 crore national mission on education through information and communication technology (NMEICT), launched in 2009.</p></div>
