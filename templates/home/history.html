      In March 2012, the Aakash project was transferred to IIT
      Bombay, with CDAC as its testing partner. As IIT Rajasthan
      had selected Datawind through due diligence, following all CAG
      norms, IIT Bombay decided to procure Aakash II from the same
      vendor. IIT Bombay negotiated with Datawind once again and
      froze the prices at Rs. 2,263. </br>In July 2012, Datawind
      agreed to upgrade the device without any
      cost escalation. The new device would have 512 MB RAM, 1GHz
      ARM Cortex A8 processor, Android 4.0 operating system, and a
      gravity sensor, all upgrades over the purchase order issued
      by IIT Bombay in May 2012.The specifications of this device
      are 800 MHz ARM Cortex A8, 256 MB RAM, 2GB NAND flash, 2GB
      SD card, 7”display with 800x480 resolution, four point multi
      touch projective capacitive touch panel, Android 2.3 or
      later. They also agreed to provide the tablet at Rs. 2,276,
      the rupee equivalent of $49.98 on the day the purchase order
      was placed. This would more correctly account for the
      delays, while protecting against the fluctuations in the
      exchange rates. This new improved device was christened as
      Aakash II.</br></p>

      The low cost access and computing device was christened Aakash
      and was launched on 5 Oct. 2011 by the then Human Resource
      Development Minister, Shri Kapil Sibal.  In order to bring
      Aakash closer to people’s expectations, the specifications were
      redrawn in a meeting held between MHRD, IIT Rajasthan, and
      Datawind in Nov. 2011. In this meeting, Datawind agreed to
      provide a capacitive touch screen in lieu of the resistive
      screen.<br>Aakash tablet is part of the central government Rs
      4,612 crore national mission on education through information and
      communication technology (NMEICT), launched in 2009.</br></p>

      <h4>NMEICT</h4>
	<p align="justify">
      National Mission on Education through ICT (NMEICT) was launched
      by Human Resource Development Minister Shri Arjun Singh
      inaugurated at Tirupati on 2 Feb. 2009, with an outlay of
      Rs. 4,612 crore, equivalent to one billion US$ at the prevailing
      exchange rates. Out of this sum, about 60% was allocated to
      provide good bandwidth to universities and colleges, and the
      remaining was meant for content development and a low cost
      access and computing device.  The objective of this mission was
      to raise the levels of education in India. It was an initiative
      of the Department of Higher Education, MHRD, Government of
      India.</p>
