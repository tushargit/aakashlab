		  In order to train teachers and students of these colleges, we planned two training programs.
		  The first was a 2 day orientation program for teachers, which was conducted on 10, 11 November
		  2012. Over 13,000 teachers from the APCs, participated in this program.</br>
		  An Aakash Research Fellowship Award contest was announced for participating teachers.
		  They were asked to form teams, and write essays on how best to utilize Aakash tablets to
		  enhance the effectiveness of learning process, and to improve quality of education in engineering
		  colleges. More than 2000 submissions have since been received. These are being evaluated
		  through a peer review process.</br></br>
		  A training program for students from these colleges, was similarly planned and conducted over
		  2 weekends: 23-24 February 2013, and 3-4 March 2013. More than 30,000 students originally
		  registered for this training program. Because of the restricted lab facilities in our Remote
		  Centres, we could accommodate only about 8,000 of these to attend the program and complete
		  all quizzes and assignments, and they were awarded certificates. The program was greatly
		  appreciated by the participants.</br></br>

      <p  style="text-align:justify; font-size:16px;">Like each year, good students from different colleges are invited to work at IIT Bombay during
	summer months as interns. This year, the Aakash project announced a large scale internship
	program. Over 3,000 students across the country applied. A total of 160 students from 80
	colleges in the country were admitted to the internship program.</br>
	All these students were given extensive training in Android apllication development. Covering
	all the topics listed in the previous section, teams of interns developed several useful applications. These have
	been added to the Aakash repository of Open Source applications.</p>
